# EpicodusGames

This is an Epicodus project where I gather silly games we've encountered as practices throughout the course and building them out in Android studio, with android specific layout and functionalities.

Week 1
#Boggle
1.Epicodus's version of Boggle is a game that:
         * Randomly generates string of 16 letters, with 2 or more letters being vowels.
         * User can make English words from the 8 letters and input it into the blank field below and submit the word for checking.
            1.The word must be 3 letters or longer, a valid english word, and only contains letters from the generated string.
         * The user can drag-drop to rearrange the string letters for their own convenience.
         * The user can press Enter from the keyboard directly to submit the word, so that the user does not have to hide the keyboard after typing.
         * The user can manually click a button to start a new round/string.
         * Each round is time limited by a count-down-timer.
            1. New round or string will reset the timer.
            2. Submitting a word or pressing Back Button will cancel the timer.
            3. Running out of time will start a new round(recursive).
         * At the end of round, user will see their score, which is calculated by the number of correct words they got.
